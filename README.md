# aqueducts

Aqueducts is a short simple puzzle game made for [Ludum Dare 36 (theme: Ancient Technology)](http://ludumdare.com/compo/).

Goal: Bring water from the lake to the town by connecting them via aqueducts. 

Rules: 
- Path from lake to town must be complete. You don't want to lose water!
- Your workers are lazy and have placed down too many aqueduct parts. Not all tiles will always be used.
- Lakes are stationary, so they cannot be turned.
