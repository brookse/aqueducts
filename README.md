Aqueducts is a short simple puzzle game made for [Ludum Dare 36 (theme: Ancient Technology)](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) by [Lyzzi Brooks](https://twitter.com/Lyzzi_Lightyear) and Adam Marchetti using [Phaser.io](http://phaser.io/).

Goal: Bring water from the lake to the town by connecting them via aqueducts. 

Rules: 
- Path from lake (blue tile) to town (orange tile) must be complete. You don't want to lose water!
- Your workers are lazy and have placed down too many aqueduct parts. Not all tiles will always be used.
- Lakes are stationary, so they cannot be turned.
- Some lakes can service multiple towns.
- There should be only one way to solve each level.
